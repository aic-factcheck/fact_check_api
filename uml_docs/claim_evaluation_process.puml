# Start by collecting all the reviews for the selected claim.

1) Calculate the total number of positive, negative, and neutral votes for each review.
2) Calculate the positivity ratio for each review by dividing the number of positive votes by the sum of positive,negative, and neutral votes.
3) Assign weights to the positivity ratio and the number of negative votes based on your desired balance between them.
4) Calculate the weighted score for each review by multiplying the positivity ratio by its weight and subtracting the number of negative votes multiplied by its weight.
5) Rank the reviews based on their weighted scores.
6) Select the review with the highest rank as the winner or optimal review for the claim.
7) Let's recalculate the weighted scores using this updated approach:

Example:
---
Claim: "The sky is blue."

Reviews:

Review 1: 5 positive votes, 10 negative votes, 5 neutral votes
Review 2: 15 positive votes, 2 negative votes, 0 neutral votes
Review 3: 8 positive votes, 5 negative votes, 3 neutral votes
Review 4: 8 positive votes, 0 negative votes, 0 neutral votes
Review 5: 25 positive votes, 10 negative votes, 1 neutral vote
Weights:

Weight for positivity ratio: 0.6
Weight for number of negative votes: -0.4
Calculations:

Review 1: Positivity ratio = 5 / (5 + 10 + 5) = 0.25
Weighted score = (0.25 * 0.6) + (10 * -0.4) = 0.15
Review 2: Positivity ratio = 15 / (15 + 2 + 0) = 0.882
Weighted score = (0.882 * 0.6) + (2 * -0.4) = 0.792
Review 3: Positivity ratio = 8 / (8 + 5 + 3) = 0.381
Weighted score = (0.381 * 0.6) + (5 * -0.4) = 0.348
Review 4: Positivity ratio = 8 / (8 + 0 + 0) = 1
Weighted score = (1 * 0.6) + (0 * -0.4) = 0.6
Review 5: Positivity ratio = 25 / (25 + 10 + 1) = 0.694
Weighted score = (0.694 * 0.6) + (10 * -0.4) = 0.416
Ranking:

Review 2: Weighted score: 0.792
Review 1: Weighted score: 0.15
Review 3: Weighted score: 0.348
Review 4: Weighted score: 0.6
Review 5: Weighted score: 0.416
In this updated approach, Review 2 is now the optimal review since it has the highest rank,
taking into account both the positivity ratio and the number of negative votes.
Review 2 has the fewest negative votes among the reviews, making it the preferred choice based on the given criteria.
