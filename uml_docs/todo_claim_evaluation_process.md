1. Select all reviews for selected claim
2. Calculate the total number of positive, negative, and neutral votes for each review.
3. Calculate the positivity ratio for each review by dividing the number of positive votes by the sum of positive, negative, and neutral votes.
4. Assign weights to the positivity ratio, the number of negative votes, and the number of neutral votes based on your desired balance between them.
5. Calculate the weighted score for each review by multiplying the positivity ratio by its weight, subtracting the number of negative votes multiplied by its weight, and subtracting the number of neutral votes multiplied by its negative weight.
6. Rank the reviews based on their weighted scores.
7. Select the review with the highest rank as the winner or optimal review for the claim.

Example:
Claim: "The sky is blue."

Reviews:

Review 1: 5 positive votes, 10 negative votes, 5 neutral votes
Review 2: 15 positive votes, 2 negative votes, 0 neutral votes
Review 3: 8 positive votes, 5 negative votes, 3 neutral votes
Review 4: 8 positive votes, 0 negative votes, 0 neutral votes
Review 5: 25 positive votes, 10 negative votes, 1 neutral vote

Weights:

Weight for positivity ratio: 0.6
Weight for number of negative votes: -0.4
Weight for number of neutral votes: -0.1 (small negative weight)

Calculations:

Review 1: Positivity ratio = 5 / (5 + 10 + 5) = 0.25
Weighted score = (0.25 _ 0.6) + (10 _ -0.4) + (5 \* -0.1) = 0.1

Review 2: Positivity ratio = 15 / (15 + 2 + 0) = 0.882
Weighted score = (0.882 _ 0.6) + (2 _ -0.4) + (0 \* -0.1) = 0.792

Review 3: Positivity ratio = 8 / (8 + 5 + 3) = 0.381
Weighted score = (0.381 _ 0.6) + (5 _ -0.4) + (3 \* -0.1) = 0.318

Review 4: Positivity ratio = 8 / (8 + 0 + 0) = 1
Weighted score = (1 _ 0.6) + (0 _ -0.4) + (0 \* -0.1) = 0.6

Review 5: Positivity ratio = 25 / (25 + 10 + 1) = 0.694
Weighted score = (0.694 _ 0.6) + (10 _ -0.4) + (1 \* -0.1) = 0.416

Ranking:

Review 2: Weighted score: 0.792
Review 4: Weighted score: 0.6
Review 5: Weighted score: 0.416
Review 1: Weighted score: 0.1
Review 3: Weighted score: 0.318
In this updated calculation, Review 2 remains the optimal review with the highest rank. It has the highest weighted
